      "name": "Bass",
      "description": "Determins how \"fat\" or \"thin\" the sound is, boosting around 250hz tend to add a feeling of warmth. If you're a bass head you most likely like this range."

    {
      "name": "Lower Mids",
      "description": "Low order harmonics of most instruments, generally viewed as the bass presence range. Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled."
    },
    {
      "name": "Midrange",
      "description": "The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix. Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn-like quality. Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue."
    },
    {
      "name": "Upper Mids",

    {
      "name": "Presence",
      "description": "The Presence range is responsible for the clarity and definition of a sound. Over-boosting can cause an irritating, harsh sound. Cutting in this range makes the sound more distant and transparent."

    {
      "name": "Treble",
      "description": "The Treble range is composed entirely of harmonics and is responsible for sparkle and air of a sound. Over boosting in this region can accentuate hiss and cause ear fatigue."
